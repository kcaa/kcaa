KCAA: KanColle Automated Assistant
==============================================================

Here is a bit more detailed documentation of KCAA (KanColle Automated

basic information. This is currently only for developers. No Japanese version
provided. (Er, you could contribute.)

For Japanese users: 翻訳が面倒くさいので日本語版はありません。ごめんなさい。
